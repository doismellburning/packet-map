# packet-map

A map of [Packet Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio) stations in the UK,
based on [ETCC](https://ukrepeater.net/) NoV data.

Built on top of [GeoJSON data rendered from published ETCC CSV data](https://github.com/doismellburning/etcc-csv-scrape),
augmented with additional local notes.

This allows adding extra information like encoding, baud rate, services, etc. although no schema is currently enforced.
